# Migration Plan to MVC Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the steps to migrate the current application to a proper MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

## Steps

### 1. Backup Current Files
```bash
# Create a backup of the current application
mkdir -p backup
cp -r *.js *.json *.sql views/ backup/
```

### 2. Implement New Structure
- Models: Database models and business logic
- Views: Already using EJS templates
- Controllers: Logic to handle requests
- Routes: Route definitions
- Config: Configuration files
- Middleware: Custom middleware functions
- Utils: Utility functions

### 3. Migration Steps

1. **Replace app.js and server.js**
   ```bash
   mv app.js.new app.js
   mv server.js.new server.js
   ```

2. **Remove Duplicate Code**
   - After testing that the new structure works, remove any duplicate files or code.
   - The following files can be removed once the migration is complete:
     - passport-config.js (root directory)
     - chatbot.js (if functionality has been moved to controllers)
     - Any other utility files that have been migrated

3. **Update Dependencies**
   - Make sure all required dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install express-validator --save
   ```

4. **Test the Application**
   - Test all functionality to ensure it works with the new structure
   - Pay special attention to:
     - Authentication
     - CRUD operations
     - Security features

### 4. Benefits of the New Structure

- **Maintainability**: Code is organized by function, making it easier to maintain
- **Testability**: Components are isolated, making them easier to test
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
- **Readability**: Code is more readable and follows standard patterns
- **Security**: Security concerns are centralized in middleware

### 5. Future Improvements

- Implement a proper ORM for database operations
- Add comprehensive test suite
- Implement API documentation
- Add more robust error handling
- Implement logging system
